[1mNAME[0m
       ldif - LDAP Data Interchange Format

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  LDAP  Data  Interchange  Format  (LDIF)  is used to represent LDAP entries and change records in text form. LDAP tools, such as [1mldapadd[22m(1) and
       [1mldapsearch[22m(1), read and write LDIF entry records.  [1mldapmodify[22m(1) reads LDIF change records.

       This manual page provides a basic description of LDIF.  A formal specification of LDIF is published in RFC 2849.

[1mENTRY RECORDS[0m
       LDIF entry records are used to represent directory entries.  The basic form of an entry record is:

            dn: <distinguished name>
            <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
            <attrdesc>: <attrvalue>
            <attrdesc>:: <base64-encoded-value>
            <attrdesc>:< <URL>
            ...

       The value may be specified as UTF-8 text or as base64 encoded data, or a URI may be provided to the location of the attribute value.

       A line may be continued by starting the next line with a single space or tab, e.g.,

            dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=exam
             ple,dc=com

       Lines beginning with a sharp sign ('#') are ignored.

       Multiple attribute values are specified on separate lines, e.g.,

            cn: Barbara J Jensen
            cn: Babs Jensen

       If an value contains a non-printing character, or begins with a space or a colon ':', the <attrtype> is followed by a double colon and the value is
       encoded in base 64 notation. e.g., the value " begins with a space" would be encoded like this:

            cn:: IGJlZ2lucyB3aXRoIGEgc3BhY2U=

       If  the  attribute  value  is  located  in  a  file,  the  <attrtype> is followed by a ':<' and a file: URI.  e.g., the value contained in the file
       /tmp/value would be listed like this:

            cn:< file:///tmp/value
       Other URI schemes (ftp,http) may be supported as well.

       Multiple entries within the same LDIF file are separated by blank lines.

[1mENTRY RECORD EXAMPLE[0m
       Here is an example of an LDIF file containing three entries.

            dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
            cn: Barbara J Jensen
            cn: Babs Jensen
            objectclass: person
            description:< file:///tmp/babs
            sn: Jensen

            dn: cn=Bjorn J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
            cn: Bjorn J Jensen
            cn: Bjorn Jensen
            objectclass: person
            sn: Jensen

            dn: cn=Jennifer J Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
            cn: Jennifer J Jensen
            cn: Jennifer Jensen
            objectclass: person
            sn: Jensen
            jpegPhoto:: /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAAAAAQABAAD/2wBDABALD
             A4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQ
             ERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVG
            ...

       Note that the description in Barbara Jensen's entry is read from file:///tmp/babs and the jpegPhoto in Jennifer Jensen's  entry  is  encoded  using
       base 64.

[1mCHANGE RECORDS[0m
       LDIF  change records are used to represent directory change requests.  Each change record starts with line indicating the distinguished name of the
       entry being changed:

            dn: <distinguishedname>

            changetype: <[modify|add|delete|modrdn]>

       Finally, the change information itself is given, the format of which depends on what kind of change was specified above.  For a [4mchangetype[24m of  [4mmod‚Äê[0m
       [4mify[24m, the format is one or more of the following:

            add: <attributetype>
            <attrdesc>: <value1>
            <attrdesc>: <value2>
            ...
            -

       Or, for a replace modification:

            replace: <attributetype>
            <attrdesc>: <value1>
            <attrdesc>: <value2>
            ...
            -

       If no [4mattributetype[24m lines are given to replace, the entire attribute is to be deleted (if present).

       Or, for a delete modification:

            delete: <attributetype>
            <attrdesc>: <value1>
            <attrdesc>: <value2>
            ...
            -

       If no [4mattributetype[24m lines are given to delete, the entire attribute is to be deleted.

       For a [4mchangetype[24m of [4madd[24m, the format is:

            <attrdesc1>: <value1>
            <attrdesc1>: <value2>
            ...
            <attrdescN>: <value1>
            <attrdescN>: <value2>

       For a [4mchangetype[24m of [4mmodrdn[24m or [4mmoddn[24m, the format is:

            newrdn: <newrdn>
            deleteoldrdn: 0 | 1
            newsuperior: <DN>

       where  a  value  of 1 for deleteoldrdn means to delete the values forming the old rdn from the entry, and a value of 0 means to leave the values as
       non-distinguished attributes in the entry.  The newsuperior line is optional and, if present, specifies the new superior to move the entry to.

       For a [4mchangetype[24m of [4mdelete[24m, no additional information is needed in the record.

       Note that attribute values may be presented using base64 or in files as described for entry records.  Lines in change records may be  continued  in
       the manner described for entry records as well.

[1mCHANGE RECORD EXAMPLE[0m
       The following sample LDIF file contains a change record of each type of change.

            dn: cn=Babs Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
            changetype: add
            objectclass: person
            objectclass: extensibleObject
            cn: babs
            cn: babs jensen
            sn: jensen

            dn: cn=Babs Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
            changetype: modify
            add: givenName
            givenName: Barbara
            givenName: babs
            -
            replace: description
            description: the fabulous babs
            -
            delete: sn
            sn: jensen
            -

            dn: cn=Babs Jensen,dc=example,dc=com
            changetype: modrdn
            newrdn: cn=Barbara J Jensen
            deleteoldrdn: 0
            newsuperior: ou=People,dc=example,dc=com

            dn: cn=Barbara J Jensen,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
            changetype: delete

[1mINCLUDE STATEMENT[0m
       The  LDIF  parser has been extended to support an [1minclude [22mstatement for referencing other LDIF files.  The [1minclude [22mstatement must be separated from
       other records by a blank line.  The referenced file is specified using a file: URI and all of its contents are incorporated as if they were part of
       the original LDIF file. As above, other URI schemes may be supported. For example:

            dn: dc=example,dc=com
            objectclass: domain
            dc: example

            include: file:///tmp/example.com.ldif

            dn: dc=example,dc=org
            objectclass: domain
            dc: example
       This  feature is not part of the LDIF specification in RFC 2849 but is expected to appear in a future revision of this spec. It is supported by the
       [1mldapadd[22m(1), [1mldapmodify[22m(1), and [1mslapadd[22m(8) commands.
